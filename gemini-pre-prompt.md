Please improve this prompt:

"""
I now have this codebase. I am very happy with the API, and much of the material. 

I think that because it was developed in a custom framework, and then migrated to the model context protocol python sdk, there is too much code debt to recover from. 

I therefore wish to re-write from scratch this framework.

Your aim is to produce a markdown report of the core API details, and a strategy for writing from scratch in the python SDK, which I can hand to a contractor to improve.

Here is the codebase:
```
INSERT CODEBASE HERE
```

And here is the README for the python SDK:
```
INSERT README HERE
```

Please extract in detail (use maximum effort, no restriction on output tokens), the core API details which would be needed to re-write the framework from scratch. This should include the text from the schemas that indicate the tool descriptions, a list of tools, and a list of their methods.

I do not want you to extract any code, since this might corrupt the contractors efforts, just the logical structure of the API and the details for somebody skilled in using the MCP python SDK.
"""

I will paste in the codebase and README later, so please include a placeholder for that.
