Of course. Improving the tool's documentation (the docstring, in this case) is one of the most effective ways to solve this kind of user confusion. A well-written description acts as a mini-guide, preventing user error before it happens.

Here are a few improved versions of the `docstring`, ranging from a good direct replacement to a more comprehensive one.

---

### Option 1: Direct and Clear Replacement

This version is concise but directly addresses the core problem by explaining the "why" and "how" for code analysis.

```python
@mcp.tool()
def ask(
    prompt: str,
    agent_name: str = "session",
    files: List[str] = [],
    # other params...
) -> dict:
    """
    Sends a prompt to the AI agent. For general queries, just provide a prompt.

    For questions about code, you MUST provide context, as the AI cannot see your
    local files automatically.

    1. For a few files: Use the --files parameter.
       e.g., mcp ask --prompt "Explain this function" --files my_script.py

    2. For a whole codebase: First, generate a summary with code2prompt and
       pipe it into this tool.
       e.g., code2prompt . | mcp ask --prompt "Review this codebase for bugs"
    """
```

**Why this is better:**
*   **Problem Framing:** It explicitly states, "the AI cannot see your local files automatically," which is the core concept users are missing.
*   **Clear Choices:** It presents two distinct, numbered workflows for code analysis.
*   **Embedded Examples:** The examples are short, clear, and directly integrated into the explanation, making them easy to understand.

### Option 2: Comprehensive "Man Page" Style

This version is more verbose but follows the classic CLI help page style. It's extremely clear for users who take the time to read the help text thoroughly.

```python
@mcp.tool()
def ask(
    prompt: str,
    agent_name: str = "session",
    files: List[str] = [],
    # other params...
) -> dict:
    """
    Sends a prompt to the AI agent (Gemini) for a direct response.

    This tool is versatile and can be used for general questions or for detailed
    code analysis, but for code, you must provide the necessary context manually.

    USAGE FOR CODE ANALYSIS:

    To get accurate answers about your code, you must choose one of two methods
    to provide context to the AI:

    METHOD 1: Analyzing Specific Files
    Use the `--files` parameter to include the contents of one or more files
    directly into the context. This is best for targeted questions about
    a small number of files.

    METHOD 2: Analyzing an Entire Codebase
    For reviewing entire directories, use the `code2prompt` utility to generate
    a project summary first, then pipe its output to this `ask` tool. This is
    the recommended approach for broad questions like "review my codebase".

    EXAMPLES:

    # 1. General non-code question
    mcp ask --prompt "What are the best practices for API design?"

    # 2. Ask about a specific file using the --files parameter
    mcp ask --prompt "Is the error handling in this file robust?" --files ./src/utils/error_handler.py

    # 3. Review an entire project by piping from code2prompt
    code2prompt . | mcp ask --prompt "Based on this summary, suggest areas for refactoring."
    """
```

**Why this is better:**
*   **Structured Sections:** Uses clear headings (`USAGE FOR CODE ANALYSIS`, `EXAMPLES`) that make the description easy to scan.
*   **Explains the "Why":** It clarifies *when* to use `--files` (small-scale) versus *when* to use `code2prompt` (large-scale), guiding the user to the correct workflow.
*   **High-Quality Examples:** The examples are commented, explaining the intent of each command, which is a best practice for CLI documentation.

### Recommendation

**Option 2 is the best choice.** While longer, its clarity and structure will save users significant time and frustration. Users who run `mcp ask --help` will be presented with a clear, actionable guide that not only tells them *what* to do but also *why* and *when*. It educates them on the tool's capabilities and limitations, leading to a much better user experience and more effective use of your MCP tool.
