Prompts are billed similarly to other GPT models. Image outputs cost approximately $0.01 (low), $0.04 (medium), and $0.17 (high) for square images.
*available via the Responses API
For detailed token usage by image quality and size, see the docs.
Responses API
Our newest API combining the simplicity of Chat Completions with the built-in tool use of Assistants.

Price
Responses API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model’s input and output rates.
Chat Completions API
Build text-based conversational experiences.

Price
Chat Completions API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model's input and output rates.
Assistants API
Build assistant-like experiences with our tools.

Price
Assistants API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model's input and output rates.
Built-in tools
Extend model capabilities with built-in tools in the API Platform.

Code Interpreter

File Search Storage
$0.10 / GB of vector storage per day (first GB free)
File Search Tool Call (Responses API only)
$2.50 / 1k tool calls
Web Search Tool Call
The tokens used for built-in tools are billed at the chosen model's per-token rates.
Web search content tokens: Search content tokens are tokens retrieved from the search index and fed to the model alongside your prompt to generate an answer. For gpt-4o and gpt-4.1 models, these tokens are included in the $25/1K calls cost. For o3 and o4-mini models, search content tokens are charged at model rate.
Models  Search Content  Cost
gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1, and gpt-4.1-mini-models*  Search content tokens free  $25.00 / 1K calls
o3, o4-mini, o3-pro, and deep research models   Search content tokens billed at model rate  $10.00 / 1K calls
The billing dashboard will report gpt-4.1 and gpt-4.1-mini search line items as ‘web search tool calls | gpt-4o’ and ‘web search tool calls | gpt-4o-mini’
GB refers to binary gigabytes of storage (also known as gibibyte), where 1GB is 2^30 bytes.
