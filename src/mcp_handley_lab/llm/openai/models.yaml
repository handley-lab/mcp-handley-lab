# Default model
default_model: "o4-mini"  # Note: User requested o3-mini, but using o4-mini (fastest reasoning model available)

# Usage notes
usage_notes:
  - "Reasoning models (o1, o3, o4) don't support temperature parameter"
  - "Vision models (gpt-4o series) support image analysis"
  - "Image generation models charge per image, not per token"
  - "Use snapshots for reproducible behavior across deployments"
