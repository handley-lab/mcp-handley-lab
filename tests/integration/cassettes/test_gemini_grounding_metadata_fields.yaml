      "Apple''s WWDC 2024 announcements significantly featured a new AI system called
      \"Apple Intelligence,\" integrating AI capabilities across its devices and services.  Key
      AI announcements included:\n\n* **Apple Intelligence:** This overarching system
      powers many AI features, aiming for seamless integration across devices while
      prioritizing user privacy.  It uses on-device processing where possible and
      secure cloud processing for more complex tasks.\n\n* **Enhanced Siri:** Siri''s
      capabilities were substantially improved through Apple Intelligence. It became
      more context-aware, handled complex requests, performed cross-app actions, and
      offered typed input in addition to voice commands.\n\n* **System-wide Writing
      Tools:** AI-powered tools for rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text
      were integrated into many apps (Mail, Notes, etc.).  These tools also offered
      suggestions for different writing tones.\n\n* **AI-powered Image Generation
      (Image Playground and Image Wand):**  Users could generate original images in
      various styles (e.g., sketch, illustration, animation) based on text descriptions.  Image
      Wand, specifically within the Notes app, allowed users to enhance existing sketches.\n\n*
      **AI in Photos App:** The Photos app received AI enhancements for improved image
      searching and organization using natural language.\n\n* **Improved Notifications:**
      Apple Intelligence prioritized notifications, intelligently surfacing the most
      important ones.\n\n* **Genmoji:**  This feature enabled users to create custom
      emoji based on text descriptions, even using images of people from their photo
      library.\n\n* **ChatGPT Integration:**  Apple partnered with OpenAI to integrate
      ChatGPT 4.0 into its ecosystem. Siri could leverage ChatGPT for complex requests,
      and users could access ChatGPT directly (with free and paid options). Apple
      emphasized that user data privacy was protected, and user requests and information
      were not logged by OpenAI.  Apple also planned to integrate other AI models
      in the future.\n\nThe rollout of these features began with beta releases in
      summer 2024 and continued into the fall, with compatibility primarily limited
      to newer devices with the latest processors.  Apple consistently emphasized
      its commitment to user privacy in its AI development.\n"}], "role": "model"},
