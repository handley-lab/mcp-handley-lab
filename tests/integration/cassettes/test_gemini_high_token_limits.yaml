        Plants take in **carbon dioxide** from the air (through tiny pores called
        stomata) and **water** from the soil (through their roots).\\n2.  **Energy
        Source:** They use **sunlight** as their energy.\\n3.  **The \\\"Cookbook\\\":**
        This process primarily occurs in the leaves, within specialized structures
        called **chloroplasts**, which contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**.
        Chlorophyll absorbs the sunlight.\\n4.  **The Transformation:** Using the
        absorbed light energy, the plant converts the carbon dioxide and water into
