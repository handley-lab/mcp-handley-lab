        **plants** (and some other organisms) **convert light energy into chemical
        energy**, creating their own food.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown:\\n\\n1.  **Ingredients:**
        Plants take in **carbon dioxide** from the air (through tiny pores called
        stomata), **water** from the soil (through their roots), and absorb **sunlight**
        (using chlorophyll, the green pigment in their leaves).\\n2.  **The \\\"Cook\\\":**
        Inside specialized structures called **chloroplasts** in their leaves, chlorophyll
        captures the sun's energy.\\n3.  **The Process:** This captured energy is
        used to convert the carbon dioxide and water into **glucose** (a type of sugar,
        which is the plant's food source) and **oxygen**.\\n4.  **Outputs:** The plant
        uses the glucose for energy and growth, and **releases oxygen** as a byproduct
        into the atmosphere.\\n\\nEssentially, it's how plants \\\"eat\\\" sunlight,
        carbon dioxide, and water to grow, while also producing the oxygen vital for
        most life on Earth.\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n
