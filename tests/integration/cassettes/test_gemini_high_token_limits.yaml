        in **carbon dioxide** from the air through tiny pores in their leaves, and
        **water** from the soil through their roots.\\n2.  **Energy Source:** They
        use **sunlight** as the energy source.\\n3.  **The \\\"Cookbook\\\":** This
        all happens in specialized structures within their cells called **chloroplasts**,
        which contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**. Chlorophyll is what
        captures the sunlight.\\n4.  **The Transformation:** Inside the chloroplasts,
        the plant uses the captured light energy to convert the carbon dioxide and
        water into **glucose** (a type of sugar, which is the plant's food\"\n          }\n
