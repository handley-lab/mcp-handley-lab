        \ **File: `tmpxdvj3ect.toml`**\\n    *   **Type:** This is a **TOML (Tom's
        Obvious, Minimal Language) configuration file**.\\n    *   **Content:** It
        contains structured data in key-value pairs, typically used for defining metadata
        or settings for a project or application. In this specific case, it defines
        a `[package]` section with a `name` (\\\"test\\\") and a `version` (\\\"1.0.0\\\").
        This format is commonly used in Rust projects (e.g., `Cargo.toml`), Python
        projects (e.g., `pyproject.toml`), and various other tools for configuration.\\n\\n2.
        \ **File: `tmprzpt0v_j.diff`**\\n    *   **Type:** This is a **Diff file**
        (specifically, a unified diff or Git diff).\\n    *   **Content:** It shows
        the differences between two versions of a file or set of files. The content
        `diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt\\\\n+added line` indicates that a line containing
        \\\"added line\\\" was added to a file named `file.txt`. These files are generated
        by version control systems (like Git) or diff utilities to track changes between
        file versions.\\n\\n3.  **File: `tmppw36kv64.rs`**\\n    *   **Type:** This
        is a **Rust source code file**.\\n    *   **Content:** It contains source
        code written in the Rust programming language. This particular code defines
        a `main` function, which is the entry point for Rust programs, and uses the
        `println!` macro to print the string \\\"Hello Rust!\\\" to the console when
        the program is compiled and executed.\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\":
