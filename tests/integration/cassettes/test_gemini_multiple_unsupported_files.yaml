        \ **File: `tmpfmu16lv7.toml`**\\n    *   **Type:** This is a **TOML** (Tom's
        Obvious, Minimal Language) file. The `.toml` extension is standard for this
        format.\\n    *   **Content:** TOML files are configuration files used for
        storing settings and metadata in a human-readable, key-value pair format.
        In this specific example, it contains basic metadata for a \\\"package,\\\"
        defining its `name` as \\\"test\\\" and `version` as \\\"1.0.0\\\". This structure
        is very common in Rust projects (e.g., in a `Cargo.toml` file) or other software
        projects for defining project details.\\n\\n2.  **File: `tmpnh559lb3.diff`**\\n
        \   *   **Type:** This is a **Diff** or **Patch** file. The `.diff` extension
        is standard for this type.\\n    *   **Content:** These files record the differences
        between two versions of a file or set of files. They are commonly generated
        by version control systems (like Git, as indicated by `diff --git`) to show
        what has been added, removed, or changed. In this example, it shows that the
        line `+added line` was added to a file named `file.txt`.\\n\\n3.  **File:
        `tmpnxdubmx0.rs`**\\n    *   **Type:** This is a **Rust source code** file.
        The `.rs` extension is standard for files containing code written in the Rust
        programming language.\\n    *   **Content:** This file contains source code
        written in Rust. The code defines a `main` function, which is the entry point
        for a Rust executable program. Inside the `main` function, it uses `println!`
        to print the string \\\"Hello Rust!\\\" to the console when the program is
        executed.\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n      },\n
