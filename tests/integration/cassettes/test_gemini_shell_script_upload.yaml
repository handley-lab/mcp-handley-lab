        of building a Node.js project and then deploying its compiled output to a
        remote web server.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of what it does:\\n\\n### What
        the script does:\\n\\n1.  **Error Handling:** The `set -e` command ensures
        that the script will exit immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero
        exit code). This is crucial for build and deploy scripts, as you wouldn't
        want to proceed with deployment if the build or tests failed.\\n2.  **Build
        Process Initiation:** It prints \\\"Starting build process...\\\" to the console,
        indicating the beginning of the build phase.\\n3.  **Dependency Installation:**
        `npm install` downloads and installs all the necessary project dependencies
        listed in the `package.json` file.\\n4.  **Project Build:** `npm run build`
        executes the \\\"build\\\" script defined in the project's `package.json`.
        This typically involves compiling source code (e.g., TypeScript, Babel), bundling
        assets (e.g., Webpack, Rollup), minifying files, and preparing the application
        for production. The output of this step is usually placed in a directory like
        `dist/` or `build/`.\\n5.  **Testing:** `npm test` runs the project's automated
        tests. This step is vital to ensure that the build process hasn't introduced
        any regressions and that the application is functional before deployment.
        If tests fail, the `set -e` command will stop the script.\\n6.  **Deployment
        Initiation:** It prints \\\"Deploying to production...\\\" to the console,
        signaling the start of the deployment phase.\\n7.  **File Synchronization
        (Deployment):** `rsync -av dist/ user@server:/var/www/` is the core deployment
        command:\\n    *   `rsync`: A powerful utility for synchronizing files and
        directories, especially across networks. It's efficient because it only transfers
        files that have changed.\\n    *   `-a`: Archive mode. This is a shorthand
        for several options (`-rlptgoD`) that ensure permissions, ownership, timestamps,
        symbolic links, and device files are preserved. It's ideal for deployments.\\n
        \   *   `-v`: Verbose. It shows the files being transferred, which is helpful
        for monitoring.\\n    *   `dist/`: This is the source directory on the local
        machine (where the script is run) containing the built application files.\\n
        \   *   `user@server:/var/www/`: This is the destination on the remote server.\\n
        \       *   `user`: The SSH username to connect with.\\n        *   `server`:
        The hostname or IP address of the remote server.\\n        *   `/var/www/`:
        The target directory on the remote server where the application files will
        be deployed.\\n8.  **Deployment Completion:** It prints \\\"Deployment complete!\\\"
        to the console, indicating that all steps have finished successfully.\\n\\n###
        Main Steps:\\n\\n1.  **Preparation & Error Handling:** Sets up the script
        to exit on error (`set -e`).\\n2.  **Build Phase:**\\n    *   Installs project
        dependencies.\\n    *   Executes the project's build command to compile and
        prepare files for production.\\n    *   Runs automated tests to verify the
        build's integrity and functionality.\\n3.  **Deployment Phase:**\\n    *   Copies
        the built application files from the local `dist/` directory to a specified
        directory on a remote server using `rsync`.\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\":
